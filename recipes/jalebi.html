            <li>1/4 teaspoon green cardamom</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon edible food color</li>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Jalebi batter and let it ferment overnight
                <p>To make this easy Jalebi recipe, mix together all-purpose flour, cornflour and baking soda in a bowl. Now, add ghee and food colour to the above mixture. To make a thick batter add hung curd and water. Mix well until it is thick but has a slightly flowing consistency. Keep it aside for 8-10 hours to ferment. This step is important to give that unique "khatta" taste to Jalebi. To make the sugar syrup, heat water in a pan over medium flame. Add sugar and mix until fully dissolved. Simmer the syrup until it attains one string consistency. Add saffron, cardamom powder and rose essence. Stir well.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Deep fry the Jalebis
                <p>Now, heat oil in a pan over medium flame for deep frying. Fill the jalebi batter in a muslin cloth and pierce a small hole in the cloth. Squeeze the muslin cloth to make concentric circles. Move from inside to outside to make perfect circles. Fry till jalebis are crisp and golden.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Soak the Jalebis in sugar syrup and 2-3 minutes and serve warm with Rabri
                <p>Soak the jalebis in sugar syrup for 2-3 minutes. Ensure that the sugar syrup is warm and not very hot. Now, remove from the syrup and place it on a tray lined with butter paper or foil. Decorate with silver foil (optional) and serve the jalebis hot, warm or at room temperature with creamy Rabri. Note: To make the jalebi even more delicious, add a little bit of ghee to the batter, this will give your jalebi that perfect aroma. To the crispy Jalebi, don't forget to ferment the batter overnight.</p>
